### 1.Bulls and cows
A simple logic game popular among students and school children.

The computer generates a number thst you are given several attempts to guess.
The correct digits standing on their places - are bulls, the correct digits standing on their wrong places - are cows.
For example: computer the generate number 1836, on first attempt you input 6815, computer returns answer:
>1 bulls, 2 cows

it means that 1 digit in your number is right and standing on their place (digit 8), and two digits is right, but standing on wrong places (digits 6 and 1).
